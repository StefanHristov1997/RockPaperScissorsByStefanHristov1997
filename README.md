# "Rock_Paper_Scissors" Console Game ⭐ ⭐
The simple console game made by me for the first student project in Software university in Bulgaria. 🙂 🙂

Rock - Paper - Scissors is a simple two player game where you and your opponent (the computer) simultaneously
choose one of the following three options: "rock", "paper" or "scissors". The rules are as follows:

> Rock beats scissors (the scissors get broken by the rock)

> Scissors beats paper (the paper gets cut by the scissors)

> Paper beats rock (the paper covers the rock)

The winner is the player whose choice beats the choice of his opponent. If both players choose the same option
(e.g. "paper"), the game outcome is "draw": 😜

# INPUT & OUTPUT

Тhe player has these options in front of him:

> To enter "rock" or "r"

> To enter "paper" or "p"

> To enter "scissors" or "s"

> If the player enters a different command, the console returns a message that he entered an invalid input. ◀️ 

Computer chooses randomly, then the result is announced.

# Solution

> First of all I printed on console the player options.

> Then I did an if-else check to declare the selection.

> After check I used random variable with nextInt() method, so that the computer can randomly select from "rock", "paper" or "scissors".

> I ended up using an if-else check for possible moves from the attached table.
